# 7DaysOfReactNative

This repository is a reflection of my efforts to learn React Native and implement its core concepts within just one week. It is structured to include small experimental tasks and projects that explore various aspects of React Native development, from JavaScript fundamentals to advanced concepts like Redux and animations.

While I understand that mastering React Native in a week is ambitious, this repository represents a solid starting point for my journey. It is not just about achieving mastery but about laying down a strong foundation that I can continue to build upon.
